ResInsight can create summary cross plots based on vectors from SUMMARY files (`*.SMSPEC`) and imported Observed Time History Data. Summary cross plots are very similar to [Summary Plots]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/summaryplots). While an ordinary summary plot displays summary vectors against time, a summary cross plot displays one vector against another vector.
