A Summary Cross Plot is a window displaying a graph in the main area of the **Plot Main Window**. It is very similar to [Summary Plots]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/summaryplots), but there are some differences:

- Summary Cross Plot displays one vector against another vector, not one vector against time
- Not possible to paste Excel/CSV data to a summary cross plot
- Summary cross plots have no [Plot Editor]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/summaryploteditor)
-

To create a new Summary Cross Plot, select the context command ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SummaryPlot16x16.png) **New Summary Cross Plot** on the **Plot Main Window -> Project Tree -> Summary Cross Plots** item. New curves are created by using the context command **New Summary Cross Plot Curve** on a summary cross plot.

## Summary Cross Plot Curves
To display a Summary Cross Plot curve, ResInsight needs two vectors. Vector selections are made using the ** Summary Cross Plot Curve** property editor.
