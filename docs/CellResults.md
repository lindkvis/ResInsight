The main results to postprocess in ResInsight are Cell Results. A Cell Result is one value, or a small set of values per 
cell over a region of the grid. A Cell Result is also referred to as a *Property*.

Cell Results are used in several operations and settings: 

- **Cell Colors**
- **Cell Edge Result** (Eclipse Only)
- **Separate Fault Result** (Eclipse Only)
- **Property Filters**
- **Well Log Extraction Curves** 
- **Cell Result Time History Curves**

In the property panel of all those, the same options are used to define the Cell Result of interest. 
In the following we will describe these options. 

## Eclipse Result Types

As shown in the picture below, there are 6 different result types

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CellResultTypes.png)

- **Dynamic** -- Time varying properties from the Eclipse simulation
- **Static** -- Eclipse properties that does not vary with time. Some derived properties calculated by ResInsight are also present.
- **Generated** -- Results generated by an Octave Script ends up here
- **Input Property** -- Directly imported Eclipse properties from ascii files is shown in this category
- **Formation Names** -- Lists only the Active Formation Names selected on the case.  ( See [Formations]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/formations) )
- **Flow Diagnostics** -- Flow diagnostic results are derived from the flux field in the Eclipse result data file and is only 
  available if those results are present. This option is described in detail below.

## Flow Diagnostic Results

ResInsight has embedded Flow Diagnostics calculations made available using the **Flow Diagnostics** result type. 
These results make it easier to see how and where wells interact with the reservoir and each other. 
It is possible to select exactly what wells to investigate, and even the possible *opposite flow* part of the well.

Se also [ Flow Diagnostics Plots]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/flowdiagnosticsplots) and [ Flow Characteristics Plot]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/flowdiagnosticsplots#flow-characteristics-plot) 

### Method

The calculations are performed by a library called [opm-flowdiagnostics](https://github.com/OPM/opm-flowdiagnostics) developed by [SINTEF Digital](http://www.sintef.no/sintef-ikt/#/). A more elaborate description of the technique and how it can be  utilized, can be found at Sintef's web site [here](http://www.sintef.no/projectweb/mrst/modules/diagnostics/). The MRST tool described is a Matlab predecessor of the flow diagnostics calculations developed for ResInsight.

The methodology is also described in: 
[The application of flow diagnostics for reservoir management](http://folk.ntnu.no/andreas/papers/diagnostics.pdf) SPE J., Vol. 20, No. 2, pp. 306-323, 2015. DOI: [10.2118/171557-PA](https://dx.doi.org/10.2118/171557-PA)

### Cross Flow and Opposite Flow

The *opposite flow* of a well denotes the flow that is opposite to the expected normal state of the well. Eg. parts of a producer might actually be injecting due to cross flow, and an injector could be producing in some sections.
Each well is assigned an opposite flow name by adding "-XF" to the end of the name. "-XF" was chosen as a reference to Cross Flow.

In this way, a producer will have two tracer names: The "well name" as a producer tracer, and "well name-XF" as an injector tracer.

### Defining results 

There are several options available to define the particular result you want to target, as shown below:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CellResultFlowDiagnostics.png)

There are two main selections you need to make: The tracers and the result property 
- **Tracers** -- Option to select how/what tracers to use. Available options are:
    - **All Injectors and Producers** --  Selects all the wells, including the opposite flow tracers
    - **All Producers** -- Selects all producer tracers, including the opposite flow tracers of injectors.
    - **All Injectors** -- Selects all injector tracers, including the opposite flow tracers of producers.
    - **By Selection** -- Displays a list of all the tracers that can be selected freely, and a **Filter** field. 
       - The list of selectable tracers can be filtered using wild card search of their names.
       - The tracers are sorted by their overall status as producer or injectors and prefixed depending on the status.
         Injectors are prefixed with "I :", producers with "P :" and wells with varying state "I/P:".
- **Result property** -- Displays a list of the available results:
    - **Time Of Flight (Average)** -- The time for some fluid in the cell to reach a producer, 
    or the time it takes to reach the cell from an injector. 
    When selecting several tracers, the time of flight values from each of the tracers are weighted 
    by their cell fraction before they are averaged.
    - **Tracer Cell Fraction (Sum)** -- The volume fraction of a cell occupied by the selected tracers. 
    The injector and producer tracers counts as independent in this regard, so the sum of fractions for 
    all the producer tracers will be 1.0 and the same for the injector tracers. If both types of tracers 
    are selected, the total sum will normally reach 2.0. 
    - **Max Fraction Tracer** -- Shows which of the selected tracers that has the largest fraction in each cell. 
    This is shown as a category result displaying a color for each tracer, and the names in the legend.
    - **Injector Producer Communication** -- The communication in a cell between a set of producers and a set of injectors 
    is calculated as the sum of producer fractions multiplied by the sum of injector fractions in the cell. 
    This produces values between 0.0 and 1.0 where high values indicate that both the injectors and the producers 
    have a high influence.

### On-Demand Calculation

The flow diagnostics results are only calculated when asked for, and only for requested timesteps. This means that statistics based on all timesteps are not available for these results.


## Geomechanical Results

Geomechanical results are sorted in different **Result Position**s:
- **Nodal** -- Results given a value per node in the grid
- **Element Nodal** -- Results with values per element node
- **Integration Point** -- Results with values per integration point. These are displayed in the same way as element nodal results. 
- **Element Nodal on Face** -- Results with values transformed to element faces or intersections. 
See [Element Nodal on Face]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/derivedresults#element-nodal-on-face) for more information 
- **Formation Names** -- Lists the **Active Formation Names** selected on the case. ( See [Formations]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/formations) )

### Relative Result Options

This group of options controls time-lapse results to be calculated. ( See [Relative Results]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/derivedresults#relative-results-time-lapse-results) for more information )
