The main results to postprocess in ResInsight are Cell Results. A Cell Result is one value, or a small set of values per 
cell over a region of the grid. A Cell Result is also reffered to as a *Property*.

Cell Results are used in several operations and settings: 

- **Cell Colors**
- **Cell Edge Result** (Eclipse Only)
- **Separate Fault Result** (Eclipse Only)
- **Property Filters**
- **Well Log Extraction Curves** 
- **Cell Result Time History Curves**

In the property panel of all those, the same options are used to define the Cell Result of interest. 
In the following we will describe these options. 

## Eclipse Result Types

As shown in the picture below, there are 6 different result types

- **Dynamic** -- Time varying properties from the Eclipse simulation
- **Static** -- Eclipse properties that does not vary with time. Some derived properties calculated by ResInsight are also present.
- **Generated** -- Results generated by an Octave Script ends up here
- **Input Property** -- Directly imported Eclipse properties from ascii files is shown in this category
- **Formation Names** -- Lists only the Active Formation Names selected on the case.  
- **Flow Diagnostics** -- Flow diagnostic results are derived from the flux field in the Eclipse result data file and is only 
  available if those results are present. This option is described in detail below.

### Flow Diagnostic Results

ResInsight has embedded Flow Diagnostics calculations, and the calculated Cell Results are available using the **Flow Diagnostics** result type. 

There are several options available to define the particular result you want to target, as shown below:
