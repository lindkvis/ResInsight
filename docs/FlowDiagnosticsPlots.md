Flow Diagnostics Plots are managed from the **Project Tree** of the **Plot Main Window** in the folder **Flow Diagnostics Plots**.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/FlowDiagnosticsPlotsProjectTree.png)

This folder contains a **Flow Characteristics Plot**, a default **Well Allocation Plot** and a **Stored Plots** folder containing stored **Well Allocation Plots**.

## Flow Characteristics Plot

This window displays three different graphs describing the overall behaviour of the reservoir for each timestep. The timesteps available are only the ones flow diagnostics results has been requested. 

- **Lorenz Coefficient** -- This plot displys the lorenz coefficient for the complete reservoir for each calculated timestep. The background is colored to serve as a reference for the timestep in the other graphs.
- **Flow Capacity vs Storage Capacity** -- This plot displays one curve for each timestep of the F-phi curve for the reservoir. The color of the curve indicates the timestep, and can be looked up in the background color of the **Lorenz Coefficient** plot.
- **Sweep Efficiency** -- This plot displays one Sweep Efficiency curve for each calculated timestep.  The color of the curve indicates the timestep.

## Well Allocation Plots

Well allocation plots show the flow along a specified well, along with either phase distribution or the amount of support from/to other wells. The total phase or allocation is shown in the legend and as a pie chart, while the well flow is shown in a depth value vs flow graph.  

### Creating Well Allocation Plots

To plot the Well allocation for a well, right click the well in the **Project Tree** or in the **3D View** and invoke the command **Plot Well Allocation**.

The command updates the default **Well Allocation Plot** with new values based on the selection and the settings in the active view. This plot can then be copied to the **Stored Plots** folder by the context command **Add Stored Well Allocation Plot**. 

### Options

The **Legend**, **Total Allocation** pie chart, and the **Well Flow/Allocation** can be turned on or off from the toggles in the **Project Tree**. 

Below the property panel of a Well Allocation Plot is shown:
