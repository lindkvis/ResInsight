There are currently two types of Flow Diagnostics related plots:

- **Well Allocation Plots**
- **Flow Characteristics**

They are managed from the **Project Tree** in the **Plot Main Window** in the folder **Flow Diagnostics Plots**.

This plot can be copied to the **Stored Plots** folder by the context command **Add Stored Well Allocation Plot** to 
store it, and compare it to other plots.
