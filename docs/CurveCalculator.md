The summary curve calculator is a tool to do relative simple vector calculations on a set of curves. The created curves can be stored for later use in the project.

The calculator can be run by pressing the calculator icon in en menu bar, or by right-clicking on either a summary case or the summary plot collection.

##Calculation Settings
To make a new calculated curve, click on "New Calculation". This will add a new calculation to "Calculated Summaries". Before choosing which curves to do calculations on, a calculation expression must be made. The default expression *Calculation_1 := a + b* will do a vector addition on the curves *a* and *b* and assign it to the calculation *Calculation_1*. How to choose curves *a* and *b* will be covered in section **Summary Address Selection**. Other possible operations and functions can be found by right-clikcing in the expression window.
